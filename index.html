One could be that you are curious as to what Dragonball Z even is. Another could be that you watched it once as a kid and forgot what it was so you needed a refresher. Though a big one could be you heard the name of Dragonball z and you need a better start as to the characters involved inside. Maybe Goku is a name that stands out, perhaps you didn't know there was a character named Piccolo after the instrument. Regardless of your reasoning, welcome to the best place to figure out what it all means!</p>
