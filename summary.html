    <p id = "introduction">The general concept of this show is huge, but this page is meant to detail the world of Dragonball Z. If you want the events of the show, then take a look at the storyline arcs page. So if you want to continue to look at the world of Dragonball Z, continue reading. </p>
            <h1 id="world"> The World and the Time Period</h1>
            <p id="worldP"> The world of Dragonball Z takes place is a scientific fictitious future. One where the dinosaurs got cloned and repopulated. One where you can stick any item inside a small container called a capsule. In this world if you have capsules, it generally means you have valuables. With the invention of a containter being able to hold any item at will, it is possible to literally carry your house with you on the go. Capsule Corporation, the company that designed these genius inventions is now a great super power in the world. The most important thing to know about this world though is the legend of the Dragonballs. A small side note, the author of Dragonball, Akira Toriyama was influenced heavily by Science Fiction movies made by prpducers in the United States.</p>
            <h1 id="dragonballLegend">The Legend of the Dragonballs</h1>
            <p id="DBLegend"> There is a legend, he or she who can gather the seven dragonballs will be greeted by the dragon who owns the dragonballs, "Shenron". Shenron will grant the person who finds all seven a single wish. There is a guardian over Earth who is responsible for them. His name is Kami.</p>
            <h1 id="kai">The Kais</h1>
            <p id="kaip">The universe is overseen by various levels of kais or Gods in this world. The first level is the kai's that deal with civilizations in their respective Quadrants of the Universe. You have them divided into North, East, West, and South Kais. The Kai that oversees them is the Grand Kai. Each Kai makes sure that there is nothing that will destroy or abolish a great amount of civilization. They are protectors of the Universe.</p>
